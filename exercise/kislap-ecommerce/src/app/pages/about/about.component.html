        <p class="story-description">
          Kislap was born from a simple yet powerful belief: Filipino beauty deserves products 
          that are specifically designed for our unique skin types, climate, and cultural preferences. 
          Founded in 2020 by Maria Santos, a beauty enthusiast who struggled to find makeup that 
          worked perfectly with her Filipino skin.
        </p>
        <p class="story-description">
          After years of mixing different products to achieve the perfect look, Maria realized 
          there was a gap in the market. Why should Filipinas have to choose between makeup and 
          skincare? Why not have both in one revolutionary product?
        </p>
        <p class="story-description">
          Today, Kislap is proud to be the first Filipino brand to specialize in hybrid makeup-skincare 
          products, helping thousands of women achieve their perfect glow while caring for their skin.
